# Data-Subject-Rights

Hosted in this repository are the technical specifications for the IAB Data Subject Rights & Data Deletion Request Framework. 

### About the Data Deletion Request Framework

The Data Deletion Request Framework aims to address the challenge of handling data deletion requests within the adtech ecosystem. This framework establishes a standardized mechanism for transmitting data deletion requests signals throughout the digital advertising chain. It includes provisions for recipients to indicate necessary requirements for executing deletion requests, validate request origins, ensure requester authenticity, confirm receipt, and employ cryptographic signatures for request and receipt authentication. IAB Tech Lab stewards the development of these technical specifications.
